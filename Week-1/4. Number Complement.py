Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Constraints:
1. The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. num >= 1
3. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
4. This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

Solution:              
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        temp = num
        bit = 1
        while temp :
            num = num ^ bit
            bit = bit << 1
            temp = temp >> 1
        return num
