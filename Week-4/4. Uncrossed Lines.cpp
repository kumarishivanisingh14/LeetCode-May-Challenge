We write the integers of A and B (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.
Now, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers A[i] and B[j] such that:
      A[i] == B[j];
      The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

Solution:    
class Solution {
public:
    int maxUncrossedLines(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(A.size() + 1, vector<int>(B.size() + 1));
        for(int i = 1; i <= A.size(); i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= B.size(); j++){
                if(A[i-1] == B[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[A.size()][B.size()];
    }
};
